<p>This page attempts to <a href="#motivation">motivate you</a> to contribute to the 
STIR Open Source project and to list <a href="#how">a few
options to help</a>, including of course <a href="#contributing_code">contributing code</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="motivation">Why would you contribute?</a></h2>
<p>
This could be rather obvious, but here are a few reasons:
<ul>
<li>Hopefully, STIR has been useful to you. As you got it for free, it makes sense to give something back.</li>
<li>There's no-one funding STIR at present. Therefore,
if STIR needs to improve/grow, it can only happen via its users. 
</li>
<li>STIR is quite well-known in our relatively small community. If you help out, you will increase
your standing, kudos, and maybe even improve your chances for your dream job...</li>
<li>Making your own code available in STIR could increase your citation rate.</li>
<li>Just because you are a nice person.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>But who owns STIR?</h3> 
<p>It doesn't really matter. STIR is Open Source and comes with an appropriate license (see 
<a href="../registration">our registration page</a> and the LICENSE.txt in your distribution). That license tells you
what you can do with the STIR source code and documentation.<br /> 
<small>In the past, copyright to
parts of STIR was mostly owned by the original PARAPET partners, Hammersmith
Imanet Ltd and/or General Electric. This is still a large (but decreasing) fraction of the code.</small>
</p>

<h3>But what's the deal then with ASC?</h3>
<p>Kris Thielemans set-up <a href="http://asc.uk.com"  target="_parent">Algorithms and Consulting Ltd (ASC)</a> as an independent company. 
It does not (cannot) own STIR, but it
can provide support (for a fee), accept donations, apply for grants etc.
Hopefully, this will allow ASC to contribute to STIR in other ways (e.g.
training, hosting of web-services...).  Does that mean that ASC would
benefit from your contributions? Yes, but so does everyone else!</p>

<h2><a name="how">How can you help?</a></h2>
<p>Here are a few ways how everyone can help:</p>

<h3>Easy:</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Refer to STIR publications</em> (see the <a href="../links/publications.shtml">publications section</a>).</li>
<li><em>Helping out on the mailing lists</em><br />
It would be great if you could help answer other people's questions on the mailing lists. It 
saves time for the main developers, but also of course gives you community kudos.
</li>
<li><em>Help us to complete the list of publications that use STIR</em><br />
For recognition, but (importantly) also for grant applications, it's essential to have a list of 
publications that use STIR. 
See the <a href="../wiki/index.php?title=Publications_that_use_STIR" target="_parent">
entry on the STIR Wiki</a> on how to do this.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Slightly trickier:</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Submitting bug reports</em><br />
If you found a problem in STIR, and checked the <a href= https://github.com/UCL/STIR/issues>list of known problems</a>,
please report it via the <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/issues>issue tracker</a> or
via the stir-users mailing list. Please be as complete as you can:
STIR version, OS, compiler version, build mechanism, which libraries are you using, which STIR executable did
you run and how (give parameter files etc), or Python script etc. Of course, if you can do some debugging yourself, that'd be great.
</li>
<li><em>Contributing to the WIKI</em><br />
The  <a href="../wiki/" target="_parent">STIR Wiki</a>
is a (slowly) growing repository of information. You can help by improving/expanding it, e.g. by
contributing a tutorial using something that you achieved as an example.</li>

</li>
</ul>

<h3>More involved:</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Contribute your code</em> </li>
<li><em>Improve the documentation</em></li>
<li><em>Help redesign the web-site</em></li>
<li><em>Suggest/submit grant applications</em></li>
</ul>

<p>
Code and documentation contributions need further information but 
<strong>remember</strong> that doing the simple
things above is just as important, so please <strong>help anyway you can</strong>!
</p>



<h2><a name="contributing_code">Contributing code and/or documentation</a></h2>
<p>Great! Now we have to discuss how to get your code accepted, and issues such as copyright and licensing. </p>

<div style="border:medium double;background-color: tan; color:black">
<p><large>Summary</large> </p>
<p>You will need to 
discuss your contribution on the mailing lists and provide a
document specifying the license that the copyright owner (usually you or
your employer) wants to use for distribution. This license has to be the
<a href=https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>Apache 2.0</a>
license.</p>
</div> 
<p>Some more info follows now.</p>

<h3>Who accepts the contribution and how?</h3>
<p>STIR is currently run by volunteers who you will have to convince by
<a href="mailto:stir-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">sending email to the stir-devel list</a>. 
However, the final arbiter is currently Kris Thielemans.

You should then create a <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/issues>pull request</a>.

Of course, your chances of getting your contribution included will depend on how useful it is,
how much this was discussed
on the mailing list, what documentation/testing you make available, if you
made changes to other files in STIR etc.
<small>If it happens that
nobody volunteers to merge your changes with STIR, you can always
make your changes available elsewhere of course.</small>
</p>

<h3>Legal issues</h3>

<h4>Copyright</h4>
<p>As soon as you write software (or documentation), it is protected by
copyright law, which essentially means that the copyright owner can (in
principle) prevent anyone to copy the work, or allow to do this under some
licensing conditions. In some countries, the author of the software is the
copyright owner, but in other countries (e.g. UK) it is your employer (this
will clearly also depend on your contract). This means that 
<strong>you (probably) need to ask your employer/university permission to be able 
to add your work to STIR</strong>. You will need to confirm the copyright ownership in
the document.</p>

<h4>License</h4>
<p>STIR has grown over the years by contributions from different parties. 
Nearly all these contributions were released under the Lesser GNU Public License (LGPL)
version 2.1 or the GNU Public License (GPL) version 2. However, we have since
received agreement from nearly all contributors to switch to the
<a href=https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>Apache 2.0</a>
license, which we will use in the future. Therefore, you will have
to license your contributions under this license.</p>

<p>However, it is possible that the license used for STIR changes in the future. This will depend
on agreement of all copyright holders. To make this easier, we ask you to allow us to
relicense the code to another Open Source license.
</p>

<h4>Paperwork</h4>
<p>STIR currently has excellent information on ownership and licensing and we want to keep it that way. 
Therefore, you will need to provide an officially signed
document to confirm copyright ownership and licensing agreement.
One of the hardest parts can be to decide who owns the copyright to the software that you wrote.
In many cases, that would be your employer or university (but not always). The situation
depends on which country you live in and of course your contract terms. Once you have that sorted out,
please prepare the following letter:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="STIR_AL2_letter_v8.docx">Template letter in Word format</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please discuss details by sending email to <a href="mailto:stir@asc.uk.com?subject=STIR contribution">stir@asc.uk.com<a>.
</p>

<p>Any comments on this web-page or on the procedure? Please discuss 
by <a href="mailto:stir-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">sending email to the stir-devel list</a>.</p>
