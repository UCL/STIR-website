<h3><a href="gpl.html#TOC2"><span style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none;
text-underline:none'>Preamble</span></a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The licenses for most software are designed to take away
your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any
other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software
Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License
instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,
not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service
if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that
you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that
you know you can do these things. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that
forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program,
whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the
software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
copy, distribute and/or modify the software. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want
its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any
problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'
reputations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by
software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be
licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution
and modification follow. </p>

<h3><a href="gpl.html#TOC3"><span style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none;
text-underline:none'>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</span></a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong>0.</strong> This License applies to any program or
other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may
be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The
&quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a
&quot;work based on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without
limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as
&quot;you&quot;. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification
are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only
if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having
been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the
Program does. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong>1.</strong> You may copy and distribute verbatim
copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided
that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that
refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong>2.</strong> You may modify your copy or copies of
the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and
copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><![endif]><strong>a)</strong> You must cause the modified files
to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of
any change. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><![endif]><strong>b)</strong> You must cause any work that you
distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the
Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all
third parties under the terms of this License. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><![endif]><strong>c)</strong> If the modified program normally
reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running
for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there
is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may
redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive
but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the
Program is not required to print an announcement.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be
reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this
License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them
as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole
which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on
the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights
or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective
works based on the Program. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on
the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume
of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
scope of this License. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong>3.</strong> You may copy and distribute the Program
(or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
following: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><![endif]><strong>a)</strong> Accompany it with the complete
corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
interchange; or, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><![endif]><strong>b)</strong> Accompany it with a written offer,
valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more
than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under
the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
interchange; or, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><![endif]><strong>c)</strong> Accompany it with the information
you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This
alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
accord with Subsection b above.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the
work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and
so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
component itself accompanies the executable. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If distribution of executable or object code is made by
offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of
the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
along with the object code. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong>4.</strong> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or
distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong>5.</strong> You are not required to accept this
License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you
permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These
actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you
indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and
conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on
it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong>6.</strong> Each time you redistribute the Program
(or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a
license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are
not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong>7.</strong> If, as a consequence of a court judgment
or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to
patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so
as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program
at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or
indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to
infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity
of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public
license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide
range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she
is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee
cannot impose that choice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong>8.</strong> If the distribution and/or use of the
Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong>9.</strong> The Free Software Foundation may publish
revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If
the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this
License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong>10.</strong> If you wish to incorporate parts of the
Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different,
write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by
the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two
goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong>NO WARRANTY</strong></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong>11.</strong> BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF
CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong>12.</strong> IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY
APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER
PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE
WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES</p>
