CVS Info
--------
This is only relevant for people with access to the CVS repository of STIR.

CVS Import for the external contributions normally goes as follows:

- create new directory
- move contributed files to new directory with same sub-directory structure
as the rest of STIR (so don't merge them yet with current version of STIR).
- import into CVS. It is probably a good idea to have different branch-numbers for 
every contributor (to make sure that there are no conflicts between the different
contributions). Example:

cvs -d $CVSROOT import -d -b1.1.3 -m "Import of Shape3D enhancements by C. Ross Schmidtlein, and Assen S. Kirov" parapet RS_AK SHAPE3D_UPDATES_1_00


After this, it is possible to get only the contributed files by doing

cvs -d $CVSROOT checkout -r SHAPE3D_UPDATES_1_00 parapet


You should then be able to merge these files into current STIR using the
cvs update -j options, but I haven't tried that yet. Ideally you would
now a tag from which the contributed files were generated.

Note: this mechanism was not used for all contributions. Instead
they were merged in using their own CVS usernames (using cvs login).
