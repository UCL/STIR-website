<h2><a name="4DPETMR_sims">Simulated 4D PET-MR datasets</a></h2>
Charalampos Tsoumpas (King's College London) has made a set of simulated 4D PET-MR datasets
available that can be used freely by anyone (academia and industry) for any scientific investigation. 
You can find further information 
<a href="http://www.isd.kcl.ac.uk/pet-mri/simulated-data/" target=_parent>on the relevant website</a>.

<h2><a name="STIR-Interfile">STIR-specific Interfile file format</a></h2>
<p>STIR uses a modified version of Interfile for its native data format. The modifications 
were intended to become part of Interfile 4.0 but it is not clear if this will ever
 happen. See <a href="petinterfile03.pdf" target="_parent">the original proposal as PDF</a> 
for more information on the modifications. (Note that currently, STIR does not support
images that are in strict Interfile version 3.3 format. Moreover, it only supports a subset
of the suggested new keywords).</p>

<h2><a name="GATEPET2STIR">External project to convert GATE output to STIR</a></h2>
</p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gatepet2stir/">GATE_PET_2_STIR</a> is a project 
(independent from STIR) to convert GATE data to STIR sinograms. Let us know how it works via the
mailing list.
</p>


<h2><a name="PARAPET_deliverables">PARAPET deliverables</a></h2>
<p>The PARAPET project (precursor of STIR) has a number of deliverables that are still somewhat useful
for STIR users. You can find them here.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="parapet/Task4_1.ParapetBuildingBlocks.pdf">PARAPET Deliverable 4.1: PARAPET buiding blocks documentation</a> as PDF. Note: written in 1999. 
Pretty much completely out of date with respect to STIR, but contains
slightly more documentation on the projectors.
</li>
<li><a href="parapet/Task1_3.AlgorithmSurvey.pdf">
Deliverable 1.3: PET reconstruction algorithm survey</a> as PDF. Note: written in 1997.

</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="other_packages">Other Open Source reconstruction software</a></h2>
<p>There are a number of other software packages available for PET/SPECT/CT image 
reconstruction. This is an (incomplete?) overview with some subjective comments.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fessler and his students have implemented an 
<a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/code/" target="_parent">Image Reconstruction Toolbox</a>
  as a set of open source matlab  routines for image reconstruction and processing. In addition, Fessler has also developed ASPIRE. However, this is distributed via executable files and its license allows non-commercial usage only. 
</li>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tirius/" target="_parent">TIRIUS</a> 
provides an implementation of OSEM for PET image reconstruction using a well-designed GUI. It could also use reconstruction algorithms available in STIR 1.4 but it is not compatible with STIR 2 or later. 
TIRIUS is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.
</li>
<li> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/niftyrec" target="_parent">NiftyRec</a>  provides 
a matlab (and also some python) interface to C/GPU projectors and some reconstruction 
algorithms. Current projectors are mostly suitable for SPECT. License is BSD-style.
</li>
<li><a href="http://emrecon.uni-muenster.de/" target="_parent">EMrecon</a> is another recently released package, using expectation maximisation. License is unclear</li> 
<li><a href="http://www.bme.teiath.gr/ni/EnglishVersion/Downloads_files/Downloads.html" target="_parent">QSPECT</a> is a recently released package for SPECT reconstruction using MLEM or OSEM. 
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nrezvani/OSCaR.html" target="_parent">OSCaR</a> (Rezvani et al, 2007) provides a matlab-based implementation of the FDK algorithm for Cone-beam CT  and it is freely available to AAPM members, but it is not clear if non-members can also use it.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/POSSUM" target="_parent">POSSUM</a> is an MRI
simulator which also contains FBP.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.ctsim.org/download" target="_parent">CTsim</a> is an analytic CT simulator (2D) which also contains FBP. It is not clear if this is still maintained as the
web-site does contain a lot of dead links.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.openrtk.org" target="_parent">OpenRTK</a> is a recent reconstruction 
package for (cone-beam) CT, based on ITK. License is Apache 2.0.
</li>
<li><a href="https://code.google.com/p/astra-toolbox/" target=_parent">Astra-Toolbox</a>
uses <quote> high-performance GPU primitives for 2D and 3D tomography. It supports 2D parallel and fan beam geometries, and 3D parallel and cone beam. All of them have highly flexible source/detector positioning.
A large number of 2D and 3D algorithms are available, including FBP, SIRT, SART, CGLS.</quote> License is GPL3.
</li>
<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/dvolgyes/troll" target="_parent">Troll</a>: a
pyCuda based toolkit for PET, later (now?) SPECT and CT. In early development stage (2013). License is GPL3.
</li>
<li><a href="http://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/ccpi_itr/frs/" target="_parent">regularization techniques for iterative reconstruction</a> for matlab (using mex) developed as part of the <a href="http://www.ccpi.ac.uk/">Collaborative Computational Project in Tomographic Imaging</a> which concentrates on CT. Their reconstruction software is planned to become public in 2015 or so.
</li>
<li><a href="software https://github.com/tomopy/tomopy" target="_parent">TomoPy</a>: Python-based reconstruction software from
the ANL. License is BSD-style.</li>
</ul>

All these packages concentrate on image reconstruction for static imaging. 
STIR is unique in providing a flexible open source framework for PET including scatter estimation and routines for dynamic imaging.

<h3>Some MRI reconstruction software</h3>
A very incomplete list.
<ul>
<li><a href=http://www.ismrm.org/mri_unbound/sequence.htm target="_parent">This ISMRM page</a>  lists some sequence and reconstruction packages</li>
<li><a href=http://www.cai2r.net/resources/software/agile-gpu-image-reconstruction-library target="_parent">AGILE</a> is a GPU-based 
library. Non-commercial use only.</li>
<li><a href="http://gadgetron.sourceforge.net/" target="_parent"</a>Gadgetron</a> is an open source framework for medical image reconstruction (although only MRI at present?). Depending on your scanner, it can be installed to work in parallel
to the scanner reconstruction chain. Its license is quoted as "Public Domain" on Sourceforge.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Framework for multi-modality  reconstruction software</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.ccppetmr.ac.uk">Computational Collaborative Project in Synergistic PET-MR Reconstruction</a> is developing a framework for PET-MR
reconstruction software that aims to provide interfaces to different packages.
STIR is currently selected as the first package to support PET data.
</li>
</ul>
