<h2><a name="4DPETMR_sims">Simulated 4D PET-MR datasets</a></h2>
Charalampos Tsoumpas (King's College London) has made a set of simulated 4D PET-MR datasets
available that can be used freely by anyone (academia and industry) for any scientific investigation. 
You can find further information 
<a href="http://www.isd.kcl.ac.uk/pet-mri/simulated-data/" target=_parent>on the relevant website</a>.

<h2><a name="STIR-Interfile">STIR-specific Interfile file format</a></h2>
<p>STIR uses a modified version of Interfile for its native data format. The modifications 
were intended to become part of Interfile 4.0 but it is not clear if this will ever
 happen. See <a href="petinterfile03.pdf" target="_parent">the original proposal as PDF</a> 
for more information on the modifications. (Note that currently, STIR does not support
images that are in strict Interfile version 3.3 format. Moreover, it only supports a subset
of the suggested new keywords).</p>

<h2><a name="GATESTIR">External projects to help with GATE and STIR</a></h2>
<p>STIR provides support for reading ROOT files from <a href=http://www.opengatecollaboration.org/>GATE</a>,
a Monte Carlo simulator. However, as ROOT files do not contain any information
on geometry of the scanner etc, STIR needs an additional header. In addition,
there is much more to do then just reading the data of course. The following
external projects can help</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR-GATE-Connection.git" target="_parent">STIR-GATE-Connection</a> is an open-source project aiming to facilitate the
    connection between GATE and STIR taking into account image conversions,
    conventions etc. It also estimates the data corrections needed for reconstruction.
  </li>
  <li>
</p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gatepet2stir/">GATE_PET_2_STIR</a> is a project 
to convert GATE data to STIR sinograms. It reads the GATE macros and ROOT file.
However, this project is no longer maintained and largely superseded by
functionality introduced in STIR 4.x.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="PARAPET_deliverables">PARAPET deliverables</a></h2>
<p>The PARAPET project (precursor of STIR) has a number of deliverables that are still somewhat useful
for STIR users. You can find them here.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="parapet/Task4_1.ParapetBuildingBlocks.pdf">PARAPET Deliverable 4.1: PARAPET buiding blocks documentation</a> as PDF. Note: written in 1999.

slightly more documentation on the projectors.

<h2><a name="other_packages">Other Open Source reconstruction software</a></h2>
<p>There are a number of other software packages available for PET/SPECT/CT image 
reconstruction. This is an (incomplete?) overview with some subjective comments.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jeff Fessler and his students have implemented the
<a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/code/" target="_parent">Michigan Image Reconstruction Toolbox</a>
  as a set of open source matlab  routines for image reconstruction and processing. In addition, Fessler has also developed ASPIRE. However, this is distributed via executable files and its license allows non-commercial usage only. 
</li>
<li><a href=https://github.com/NiftyPET/NiftyPET>NiftyPET</a> is Python-based
  with GPU projectors
</li>  
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tirius/" target="_parent">TIRIUS</a> 
provides an implementation of OSEM for PET image reconstruction using a well-designed GUI. It could also use reconstruction algorithms available in STIR 1.4 but it is not compatible with STIR 2 or later. 
TIRIUS is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License. Not updated since 2005.
</li>
<li> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/niftyrec" target="_parent">NiftyRec</a>  provides 
a matlab (and also some python) interface to C/GPU projectors and some reconstruction 
algorithms. Current projectors are mostly suitable for SPECT. License is BSD-style. Not updated since 2015.
</li>
<li><a href="http://emrecon.uni-muenster.de/" target="_parent">EMrecon</a> is another recently released package, using expectation maximisation. License is unclear and this might no longer be active.</li> 
<li><a href="http://www.bme.teiath.gr/ni/EnglishVersion/Downloads_files/Downloads.html" target="_parent">QSPECT</a> is a recently released package for SPECT reconstruction using MLEM or OSEM. 
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.castor-project.org/">CASToR</a> is an actively developed package intending to handle
multiple modalities. License is GPL3.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nrezvani/OSCaR.html" target="_parent">OSCaR</a> (Rezvani et al, 2007) provides a matlab-based implementation of the FDK algorithm for Cone-beam CT  and it is freely available to AAPM members, but it is not clear if non-members can also use it.
</li>
<li>

simulator which also contains FBP.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.ctsim.org/download" target="_parent">CTsim</a> is an analytic CT simulator (2D) which also contains FBP. It is not clear if this is still maintained as the
web-site does contain a lot of dead links.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.openrtk.org" target="_parent">OpenRTK</a> is a recent reconstruction 
package for (cone-beam) CT, based on ITK. License is Apache 2.0.
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.astra-toolbox.com/" target=_parent">Astra-Toolbox</a>
uses <quote> high-performance GPU primitives for 2D and 3D tomography. It supports 2D parallel and fan beam geometries, and 3D parallel and cone beam. All of them have highly flexible source/detector positioning.
A large number of 2D and 3D algorithms are available, including FBP, SIRT, SART, CGLS.</quote> License is GPL3.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/CERN/TIGRE" target=_"_parent">TIGRE</a> is an open-source toolbox for fast and accurate 3D tomographic reconstruction for any geometry. Its focus is on iterative algorithms for improved image quality that have all been optimized to run on GPUs.
It has a MATLAB and Python interface. It is licensed under the BSD.
</li>

</ul>

All these packages concentrate on image reconstruction for static imaging. 
STIR is unique in providing a flexible open source framework for PET including scatter estimation and routines for dynamic imaging.

<h3>Some MRI reconstruction software</h3>
A very incomplete list.
<ul>
<li><a href=http://www.ismrm.org/mri_unbound/sequence.htm target="_parent">This ISMRM page</a>  lists some sequence and reconstruction packages</li>
<li><a href=http://www.cai2r.net/resources/software/agile-gpu-image-reconstruction-library target="_parent">AGILE</a> is a GPU-based 
library. Non-commercial use only.</li>
<li><a href="http://gadgetron.sourceforge.net/" target="_parent"</a>Gadgetron</a> is an open source framework for medical image reconstruction (although only MRI at present?). Depending on your scanner, it can be installed to work in parallel
to the scanner reconstruction chain. Its license is quoted as "Public Domain" on Sourceforge.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Frameworks for based on other reconstruction software</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.ccpsynerbi.ac.uk">CCP SyneRBI (Computational Collaborative Project in Synergistic Reconstruction for Biomedical Imaging)</a> is developing 
<a href=https://github.com/SyneRBI/SIRF>SIRF</a>, a framework for
reconstruction software for multimodality data, providing a consistent interfaces to different packages.
STIR is currently selected as the first package to support PET and SPECT data.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/vais-ral/CCPi-Framework" target="_parent">CIL (Common Imaging Library)</a> provides a Python framework for optimisation in the context of imaging, developed by <a href="http://www.ccpi.ac.uk/">CCPi (Collaborative Computational Project in Tomographic Imaging)</a> which concentrates on CT, but plugins can be provided for projectors etc. SIRF and CIL interact closely.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/odlgroup/odl" target="_parent">ODL (Operator Disvretization Library)</a> provides a Python framework for optimisation in the context of imaging, using plug-ins to interface to many other packages, including STIR.
