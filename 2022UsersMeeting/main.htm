<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>STIR is Open Source software for use in tomographic imaging. Its aim is to
provide a Multi-Platform Object-Oriented framework for all data manipulations
in tomographic imaging. Currently, the emphasis is on image reconstruction in
emission tomography (PET and SPECT) but other imaging modalities can be added
in the future.</p>

<p>
  During this annual meeting users and developers presented their recent work with STIR with the emphasis on
  software and algorithmic development.
  In this meeting, we encourage participation and sharing. Early and preliminary works, are welcomed.<br />
<!--
