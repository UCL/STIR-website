<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>STIR is Open Source software for use in tomographic imaging. Its aim is to
provide a Multi-Platform Object-Oriented framework for all data manipulations
in tomographic imaging. Currently, the emphasis is on image reconstruction in
emission tomography (PET and SPECT) but other imaging modalities can be added
in the future.</p>

<p>
  During this annual meeting users and developers presented their recent work with STIR with the emphasis on
  software and algorithmic development.

  <b>Appropriate use of initial estimate for CRC improvement in MLEM reconstruction for low count high scatter fraction PET scan
</b></summary>

Abstract: In various cases of PET imaging, the number of events that can be acquired is low, e.g., dynamic PET imaging, PET-based beam range verification in ion beam therapy. Besides, in human PET scan count loss due to tissue scattering is significant. Hence, reconstructed image becomes very noisy. In this work, we have investigated the feasibility of a new method to improve image quality in PET for low count high scatter fraction cases. We have used rejected single scattered events to produce physically meaningful estimate of activity distribution. Richardson-Lucy iterative deconvolution method is used on broken LOR TOF backprojection of rejected events to produce estimate of activity distribution. Only uniform attenuation phantom case is investigated. Then we have used that image estimate as initial image of nonTOF MLEM reconstruction in STIR. Although general intuitive understanding about effect of appropriate initial estimate is faster convergence, this work is motivated from recent work on effect of initial estimate on MLEM reconstructed images [1]. GATE simulation of PET scanner with 5% energy resolution and 200 ps time resolution was performed. We have shown improvement of trade-off between contrast recovery coefficient (CRC) and coefficient of variation (CoV) with the conclusion that a better CRC valued final reconstructed image can be obtained if we use the deconvoluted image as initial estimate instead of uniform. We believe the proposed method for improving image quality can become practically beneficial in case of low count and high scatter fraction cases and hence worthy of further investigation.

  <b>An open online platform for the Monte Carlo simulation of realistic brain PET data integrating SimSET and STIR (SimPET)
</b></summary>

Abstract: SimPET  <a href=https://www.sim-pet.org>(www.sim-pet.org)</a> is a free cloud-based platform for the generation of realistic brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) data using SimSET and STIR. In this presentation, we will introduce the key features of the platform. In addition, we detail the work currently ongoing for introducing STIR’s latest features.<br />
Methods: The platform provides a graphical user interface to a set of automatic scripts taking care of the code execution for the phantom generation, simulation (SimSET), and tomographic image reconstruction (STIR). We characterized the performance using activity and attenuation maps derived from PET/CT and MRI data of 25 healthy subjects acquired with a GE Discovery ST, which were later simulated using different simulation models. Ongoing developments include the introduction of novel STIR features and STIR’s analytical simulation.<br />
Results: The platform can be efficiently used for generating realistic simulated FDG-PET images in a reasonable amount of time. The validation showed small differences between SimPET and acquired FDG-PET images, with errors below 10% for 98.09% (GE Discovery ST), 95.09% (GE Advance NXi), and 91.35% (Siemens Biograph mCT) of the voxels. Recent developments are focused in directly reading SimSET history files directly from STIR, which would allow to introduce Time-of-flight (TOF) and List-Mode (LM) reconstruction.<br />
Conclusions: SimPET can potentially allow scientists in clinical and research settings to perform MC simulation experiments. More recent developments are focused on improving community collaborations, allowing to easily set up and validate state-of-the art scanners.

  <b>Implementation of cylindrical PET scanners with block detector geometry in STIR
</b></summary>

Abstract: Cylindrical PET scanners are usually designed based on a block-type geometry, i.e. several rectangular blocks of crystals are arranged on a right angle prism. In STIR, the geometrical model of the scanner is a cylinder made of individual crystals equally distributed in axial and transaxial directions. The data of realistic scanners are projected onto such virtual scanners prior to image reconstruction. This results in reduced quality of the reconstructed image, especially for scanners of larger blocks. Recently, we have extended the library so that a more precise model of the scanner can be implemented. Few more parameters has been added to describe the scanner. Now, the user can choose among three options to model the scanner: (1) Cylindrical, which is the standard STIR model, (2) BlocksOnCylindrical, which is newly implemented to model regular prism-shaped geometries with regular blocks per face of the prism and (3) Generic, which is newly implemented and is able to model any irregular prism.
The new  BlocksOnCylindrical model has been evaluated using data from Monte Carlo simulation. Simulated data are reconstructed using the standard STIR model and the newly implemented BlockOnCylindrical geometry. Results show that the new implementation enhances the image quality to the extent that the results before normalization correction are comparable with those after normalization correction.
The Cylindrical model benefits from being the most symmetric model, thus the fastest reconstruction. Symmetries in (only) axial direction have been implemented for the BlocksOnCylindrical model to accelerate the reconstruction. It would be beneficial to implement symmetries in transaxial direction too.

  <b> <a href=D_Deidda_STIR-meeting2020.pdf>Implementation of a PET scanner:
  a guide to reconstruct data from your scanner in STIR</a>
</b></summary>

Abstract: The software for tomographic image reconstruction (STIR) provides reconstruction of data for a number of PET scanners. However, there are more and more commercial and research scanners being developed all the time. Some researchers may be interested to use STIR but feel unable to use it because the scanner they use is not implemented. In this presentation, a summary of the steps that are required to reconstruct data from any PET scanner is shown, with the example of the Mediso AnyScanTrio, and the appropriate classes and function will be highlighted. Among all the steps, a focus on the creation of STIR readable sinograms for prompts, attenuation, normalisation, randoms and scatter is given. To conclude, an example of how to use all your estimation for the reconstruction is shown using the OSMAPOSL parameter file.

 <b><a href=RT_STIR-GATE-Connection.pdf>STIR-GATE-Connection: A bridge between GATE and STIR</a>
</b></summary>

Abstract: Powerful Monte Carlo simulation software, such as GATE, are  useful  in emission tomography research for analysis, assisting in the assessment of new reconstruction algorithm performance, medical imaging device design, or scan protocols.
We have developed the STIR-GATE-Connection to bridge the gap between GATE and STIR and demonstrate how both sets of software can complement one another. This project allows users to setup and perform GATE simulations on a voxelised phantom (possibly generated using STIR tools) on cluster array jobs.
The <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR-GATE-Connection>STIR-GATE-Connection</a> contains scripts that allow for the rebinning of the output list mode files into STIR interfile sinograms. Furthermore, correction of scatter and random coincidence events may be estimated from the coincidence and delayed coincidence events using STIR utilities. The ability to compute the geometric normalisation factors is also present in this project.
In addition, the GE Discovery 690 and Seimens mMR scanner geometries have been implemented into this project.

 <b><a href=STIR2020_PinholeSPECT_StrugariPresentation.pdf>Preliminary image reconstruction results of single-pinhole SPECT data using STIR</a>
</b></summary>

Abstract: Despite STIR's diverse toolset for tomographic image re-construction, there is an unmet need for an open source tool capable of reconstructing pinhole-SPECT data. Originally designed for PET applications, SPECT functionality was added to STIR in 2014 with limited support of only parallel-hole collimator geometries. Prototype code has been written by Carles Falcon to model the weight matrix for multi-pinhole SPECT collimator geometries although it is not yet integrated into STIR. Using simulation data from Cubresa Inc.'s novel preclinical SPECT scanner, this work presents images reconstructed with STIR using a single-pinhole collimator to illustrate STIR's forthcoming pinhole-SPECT capabilities.

Methods: The Cubresa SPARK&trade; SPECT scanner was modelled with the Geant4 Application for Tomographic Emission (GATE) and validated according to the National Electrical Manufacturers Association NU 1-2018 standard for performance measurements of gamma cameras. Three points of Tc-99m in air were used to measure the reconstructed spatial resolution. Theoretical single-pinhole results were reconstructed with STIR whereas the experimental multi-pinhole results were reconstructed with Cubresa's software due to restricted access to the multi-pinhole collimator configuration.

Results: The SPECT reconstructed spatial resolution without scatter was measured as 1.22 mm experimentally using the multi-pinhole collimator and 1.59 mm theoretically using the single-pinhole collimator at a  fixed 2.8 cm radius of rotation.

Conclusions: Preliminary results of an acquisition involving three point-sources of Tc-99m in air demonstrates the feasibility of single-pinhole SPECT image reconstruction with STIR. Although this preliminary work utilizes a single-pinhole collimator, the prototype code used to calculate the SPECT system matrix is suitable for single- and multi-pinhole arrangements. Integration of the prototype code into the open source STIR project will expand the publicly available tomographic image reconstruction toolbox in several SPECT imaging scenarios in a user-friendly format.
