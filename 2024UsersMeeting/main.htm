                <strong>Enhancing SIMIND-SIRF Integration for Improved SPECT Modeling and Reconstruction using Residual Correction Principles</strong><br>

              <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p><p>We present new developments in the integration of the SIMIND Monte Carlo (MC) SPECT simulation tool into the Synergistic Image Reconstruction Framework (SIRF), with&nbsp;improved syntax and the full exposure of SIMIND&#39;s functionality in Python.<br />
                Also, inspired by the work of Fu and Qi (2010) on a residual correction method for high-resolution PET with positron range modelling&nbsp;(DOI: 10.1118/1.3284980), we adapt their approach to address challenging SPECT phenomena such as septal penetration. The correction&nbsp;enables a more computationally efficient modeling process than relying solely on an accurate MC model, balancing detailed system modelling&nbsp;and reconstruction speed.
                We demonstrate&nbsp;this technique with simulations of Lu-177 and Y-90 SPECT data, the latter including a simplified model for Bremsstrahlung radiation. The integration offers&nbsp;improvements in quantitative accuracy while maintaining computational feasibility.<br>
                
                We provide example scripts for generating SIMIND SPECT data from SIRF images and performing forward accurate reconstructions using SIMIND and SIRF with the hope that this will&nbsp;allow&nbsp;others to easily adopt these methods.</p>

              <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p><p>Since the release of version 6.0,&nbsp;Time of Flight (TOF)&nbsp;functionalities have been integrated into STIR master, enabling STIR to process TOF data &quot;by default&quot;. However, the traditional STIR ray-tracing projector does not support GPU utilization, resulting in very long reconstruction times. Parallelproj is a python library that allows the use of CUDA GPUs for&nbsp;fast tomographic projections. Previously, a wrapper was developed to enable the integration of the parallelproj projector with STIR for non-TOF reconstructions. In this work, we have extended the wrapper&rsquo;s functionality to support TOF data processing.</p>
              
              <p>Phantom measurements were conducted on the Siemens Biograph Vision 600 PET/CT scanner. Time-of-Flight (TOF) PET raw data were acquired, and a corresponding CT scan was performed to enable attenuation and scatter correction. The Siemens research software was then utilized for binning prompts into sinograms, estimating scatter and randoms, generating mu-maps from the CT data, and creating normalization files. A custom script, developed based on our work presented at the 2023 STIR Developer&rsquo;s Meeting, was utilized to generate sinogram data compatible with STIR.</p>
              
              <p>This data was then reconstructed using both, the original STIR raytracing projector and the STIR-wrapped version of parallelproj. Results will be presented for OSEM reconstructions of the phantom measurements using SIRF, relying on STIR for PET modelling.</p>

              <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p><p>We show the changes made to the STIR (Software for Tomographic Image Reconstruction) framework, specifically for implementing channel-edge pinhole collimators. &nbsp;The changes are implemented in the ProjMatrixByBinPinholeSPECTUB projector class, which extends the existing ProjMatrixByBin class in STIR. One of the most significant updates is the introduction of two new parameters within the collimator file. The first allows the user to choose between the knife-edge and channel-edge geometry, while the second specifies the channel&#39;s depth. For the reconstruction, the system weight projection matrix is evaluated with a geometrical approach by calculating the shadow that each image voxel projects through the channel onto the detection plane. The addition of the channel-edge pinhole geometry leaves unchanged the functionalities already implemented such as PSF (Point Spread Function), DOI Depth Of Interaction) and attenuation corrections.</p>

              <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p><p>Convergent Imaging Solutions is a software as a medical device (SaMD) manufacturer based out of Ottawa, Canada, which owns the molecular imaging workstation software called UniSyn Molecular Imaging. As part its long-term strategic plan to expand its functional capabilities in the area of nuclear medicine, the research and development team is exploring the implementation of a SPECT image reconstruction module to offer to our users. While our work toward this project is still preliminary, this paper will cover various aspects of the project ranging from the creation of the software (user) requirements to a discussion of technical issues that were encountered and how they were addressed. The discussion will close with some thoughts about some potential opportunities for STIR development that could enhance overall usability and performance.</p>

              <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p><p>Respiratory motion can lead to severe artifacts in PET and MRI images and can even render the obtained images non-diagnostic. Here we compare image-based and reconstruction-based approaches for motion correcting radial stack-of-stars anatomical MRI&nbsp;data and <sup>68</sup>Ga-FAPI-PET data using the synergistic image reconstruction package SIRF. Four minutes of MRI data was acquired&nbsp;during free breathing whereas 50 minutes of PET data includes some segments during which breath holds were being performed.&nbsp;Motion surrogates can be extracted from the MRI and the PET data for the entire scan durations. We find that these surrogates are consistent for the period during which both scans were being acquired making it possible to use MRI information to assist with&nbsp;correcting PET data. We evaluate the corrections by quantifying the contrast in the superior part of the lungs and the sharpness&nbsp;of the transition between the lungs and the diaphragm. Working with PET and MRI data together in SIRF is a powerful approach&nbsp;to reconstruct high quality images.</p>
