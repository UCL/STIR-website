<h1>STIR at the IEEE MIC 2017 Short Course on Image Reconstruction </h1>
<p>This page is for participants in the <a href="http://www.nss-mic.org/2017/public/ShortCourses.asp#SC7"  target=_blank>Short Course on Image Reconstruction</a> 
at the IEEE MIC. It will be updated with extra information before the course.
  <br />
  <strong>Please refresh the page when you re-visit.</strong> Check the bottom of page for list of updates.</p>


<!--<p>After reading this page, please fill in <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/JLS9CPJ"  target=_parent>a 1 minute survey</a>.</p>
  -->


<p>During the course, we will have practical exercises using STIR. These exercises are an integral part of the course. 
To be able to participate, <strong>students are asked to bring their own laptop if possible</strong>.
</p>

<p>We will provide a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine" target=_blank>Virtual Machine</a>
   with everything preinstalled for the course. Please <strong>follow
    the installation instructions below to get this on your laptop
    <i>before the conference</i></strong> (we will be available 30 minutes before the course to help with installation problems and will have some USB sticks with us as well).</p>
  
<p>Please note that the STIR version that we will be using is more
   recent that the current 3.0. Therefore, <strong>please use the virtual machine.</strong>
   If you really want to do this all yourself, you will need to get <a href=http://github.com/UCL/STIR target="_blank">STIR from
  github</a>, install <a href=http://www.swig.org target="_blank">SWIG</a>, Python, etc and compile STIR with
Python support. You would then need to get the data and example scripts. Don't try this...
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Please prepare for these exercises, see bottom of this page.</strong>
</p>

<h2>Virtual Machine installation instructions</h2>
<p>If you have any problems, please first re-check this web-page. If you cannot solve your
  issue, please email <tt>k dot thielemans at ucl dot ac dot uk</tt>.
</p>
<h3>Initial download and installation</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Make sure you have enough free disk-space on your laptop (~10GB for installation).</li>
  <li>Install <a href=https://www.virtualbox.org/ target="_blank">VirtualBox</a>. <strong>Please note that this will require administrator permissions</strong>.
    <br /> You do not need to install the Oracle extensions to VirtualBox, although it might come in handy for USB support. 
    <br />
       Although other Virtual Machine software might work, we have not tried this and will not be able
    to help to get this going.
  </li>
  <li> If you cannot wait to try STIR, you can download a Virtual Image from <a href="http://www.ccppetmr.ac.uk/downloads" target=_blank>
   CCP PETMR</a>. This VM contains SIRF (the CCP PETMR software for both PET and MR image reconstruction) but also STIR. After 
   installing this VM as per the instructions, please type the following in a terminal in the VM (note that this will take quite a while).
     <pre>
       update_VM.sh
       update_VM_to_full_STIR.sh
     </pre>
      <!--https://sourceforge.net/projects/stir/files/VirtualMachine1/ the Sourceforge site</a> (get the Lubuntu-STIR.ova file).
<br />
    Please be careful on Sourceforge. Do not press any attractive Download buttons as they are all ads.
-->
      <br />
    <strong><i>Warning</i>: this file is ~1.7GB</strong>. (You can of course download to a USB stick to save space on your laptop).
  </li>

<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>  The files will need another update before the course (but with minimal download time).
  In particular, the exercises themselves will still change. Therefore,
  <i>please check this web-page occasionally</i>.
</p>
<p>Update process: open the terminal and just type
<pre>
  update_VM.sh
</pre>
</p>
<p><strong>We recommend that you get yourself (somewhat) familiar with VirtualBox and Ubuntu and iPython.</strong>
  Links are provided in the HELP.htm and the exercise document on the Desktop in your VM (<a href="./exercises_document.pdf" target=_blank>click here for an out-dated version of the document).</a><br />
  Here is some suggested material:
  <ol><li>If you have never used a Linux/Unix terminal before, have a look at
      <a href=https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal target=_blank>this tutorial</a>.
    </li>
    <li><a href=https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/ target=_blank>The official Python tutorial</a>. Just read Section 1, 3, a bit of 4 and a tiny bit of 6.
    </li>
    <li><a href=https://github.com/patvarilly/dihub-python-for-data-scientists-2017/blob/master/notebooks/02_Matplotlib.ipynb target=_blank>Examples for matplotlib</a>, the python module that allows you to
      make plots almost like in MATLAB.
    </li>
  </ol>
  It would also be useful to check some of the STIR <a href=../documentation>documentation on the STIR web-site</a>.
  You could even try to run some of the exercises already.
