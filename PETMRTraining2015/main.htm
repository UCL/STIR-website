<h1>STIR at the 2nd International Training School on PET-MRI Engineering  </h1>
<p>This page is for participants in the <a href="http://www.pet-mri.eu/PETMR_School_15.html"  target=_parent>2nd Training School on PET/MR</a> 
in Leeds, UK. It will be occasionally updated with extra information. Please refresh the page when you re-visit.</p>

<!--<p>After reading this page, please fill in <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/JLS9CPJ"  target=_parent>a 1 minute survey</a>.</p>-->


<p>During the course, we will have practical exercises using STIR. These exercises are an integral part of the course. 
To be able to participate, <strong>students are asked to bring their own laptop if possible</strong>.
</p>

<p><strong>
    We highly recommend you install STIR in the vGATE virtual machine, which you need for other parts of the course.</strong>
    Check <a href="http://wiki.opengatecollaboration.org/index.php/VGate">vGATE installation instructions here.</a>
    Installation scripts for STIR in vGATE are provided below.
</p>

<p>If you do not want to use vGATE, this is possible of course.
  STIR runs on Linux, Mac OS and Windows. However, as some of the examples will use shell scripts, on Windows you will need
to install either (preferably) <a href=http://cygwin.com  target=_parent>Cygwin</a> or <a href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS"  target=_parent>MSYS</a> (we have not tried MSYS yet). You can still use Visual Studio (Express) if you prefer for the compilation.
</p>


<p>
If you want to prepare for these exercises, have a look at the files in 
examples/PET_simulation provided in the download below.

Note that some of the links below point to DropBox locations. There is no need to sign-up to
DropBox, just continue with download only.

<h2>Source code and documentation</h2>

<!--This is only necessary if you are compiling STIR yourself.-->
Please note that the STIR version that we will be using is somewhat more
recent that the current official release 3.0. Therefore, download from the link below,
even if you have already installed STIR 3.0.

This file contains the documentation as well, but you might find it easier to find this
on the <a href="stir.sourceforge.net/">STIR web-site</a>.

<br />
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ici7j5eq0v79td3/STIRsource.zip?dl=0"  target=_parent>Zip file with updated source code</a>.

<h2>Installation</h2>
Below is a link to scripts to install STIR on vGATE. The scripts should
work on other Debian systems as well, maybe even Redhat.

<br />
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/rplji00utv1l995/Install_scripts.zip?dl=0" target=_parent>zip file with scripts</a>.
<!--
 <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cpw7xd3l3yrdjbk/AAAKrAK75hmkilROKISmJmdwa?dl=0" target=_parent>Dropbox folder with scripts</a>. -->

(On Debian-based systems such as Ubuntu, these scripts will also install Amide).

<br />
<p>
  If vGATE does not work for you, you can follow then normal STIR installation instructions, part of the STIR documentation.
  Easiest is to check
  <a href="http://stir.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Installing_STIR_with_CMake">the STIR wiki</a>. 
<!--However, to make this process easier, we are in the process of providing precompiled executables. 
    We will also provide a package with data for the exercises.-->
</p>

<h2>Demo files</h2>
Please download <a href="STIR-exercises.zip">a zip file with data and scripts</a> for the exercises.

<!--

<h2>Precompiled Executables</h2>
   You will need to unzip these (they will be in a subfolder called <tt>bin</tt>)
   and either put them somewhere in your PATH or add the directory
   to your path (instructions later).
  <ul>
   <li>Linux 64 bit: <ul>
         <li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xu6a1g4yy29ibru/executables-Linux64.zip?dl=0"  target=_parent>statically linked</a> (safe but 131MB)</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/bdvnaddmwyevgod/executables-sharedlibs-Linux64.zip?dl=0"  target=_parent>dynamically linked</a> (no ITK support, 5MB)</li>
     </ul></li>
   <li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/7crweiqdklbd37c/MacOSX_executables.zip?dl=0"  target=_parent>MacOSX</a> (43MB, updated 10 Nov 8.30 UTC).
   Please also get <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/n6hblt2b9zseatw/MacOSX_list_image_info.zip?dl=0"  target=_parent>list_image_info</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/mck9sqi9o8di7zv/executables-windows.zip?dl=0" target=_parent>Windows (without Linux virtual system)</a>, 14MB, updated Monday 17.00 Seattle time (.exe extension was missing which was only ok for cygwin, added list_image_values).
<br />
 You will also need 
the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784"  target=_parent>Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013</a> and
ideally you install <a href=http://cygwin.com>Cygwin</a> (click on the
set-up link, use the defaults but ideally add tcsh)</li>
  </ul>

  -->

<h2>Other</h2>
<ul>
<li>You need a display program that understands Interfile images. We will use
<a href="http://amide.sourceforge.net">AMIDE</a> so it is best to install 
that as well.
</li>
</ul>
