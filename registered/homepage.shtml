 <li ><a href="STIR.zip">software
     as a zip file</a>.
   Ideally extract using <tt>unzip -a STIR.zip</tt>. Other unzip utilities
   might give DOS/Unix End-of-line problems.

</ul>

<p >In addition, you probably should download our 'reconstruction
test pack'. This test pack runs some  tests to check if some utilities
and reonstruction programs work as expected. This works by checking their output with output
generated by the STIR team itself, or by checking self-consistency. Download, extract anywhere
you like, and read recon_test_pack/README.txt. </p>

   Ideally extract using <tt>unzip -a recon_test_pack.zip</tt>. Other unzip utilities

</ul>
<!--
<p>Note that you could use version 1.2 of the
recon_test_pack with the current release, but it's not recommended.</p>
-->

<p>If your system does not have the boost include files, you should download 
them from the <a href=http://boost.org target="_parent">Boost web-site</a>. Note that STIR
currently does not require you to build the boost libraries, as only
the include files are used.</p>
<p>Finally, if you want ECAT support, you should get the ECAT matrix library from
Merence Sibomana and Christian Michel. However, the <a href="ftp://ftp.topo.ucl.ac.be/pub/ecat">official site</a> is sometimes
unavailable and we cannot redistribute the software due to licensing
conditions. You might find a version on the
<a href=http://www.opengatecollaboration.org/ target="_parent">OpenGATE web-site</a>. 
Please use the 
stir-users mailing list for questions.

<h2><a name="preliminary_files">Preliminary files</a></h2>
This section contains downloadable files that are currently under 
development/testing. Some might come under special license restrictions.
Use at your own risk, and check the mailing lists!

<ul>
<li><a href="LMF.shtml">Preliminary code for reading the LMF listmode format</a>. This code
is however <strong>incomplete and does not compile</strong>  and needs some work.
</li>

<li><a href="para.zip">a zip file</a> containing the
original PARAPET code for parallellisation. This will not
work with STIR in its current version unfortunately. Extract (NOT in your STIR subdirectory) and read 
READMEpara.txt.
<br />However, since version 2.1 STIR contains its own parallel code (using MPI) using similar concepts to the
PARAPET code, so these files are obsolete.

<h2><a name="other_pages">Other pages of direct relevance</a></h2>

<ul>

 <li><a
     href="../documentation/">Software documentation</a>
     </li>
 <li><a href="../wiki/" target="_parent">STIR Wiki</a></li>
 <li><a href="http://amide.sourceforge.net/" target="_parent">AMIDE</a> is a freely available
  image viewer and analysis program that can read the .hv files produced
  by STIR.</li>
<li><a href="http://xmedcon.sourceforge.net/"  target="_parent">(X)Medcon</a> is a freely 
  available conversion utility to convert various file formats.</la>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Warning:</strong><br>
Because of some unfortunate incompatiblities between Interfile 3.3 and the version of Interfile 
used by STIR, both AMIDE and xmedcon ignore the file offset field in .hv files, 
so if your the binary data does not start at file offset zero, import
into these programs will fail. You can then try the .ahv files, but this will ignore the
scale factor in the header.<br>
Luckily, all .hv files produced by STIR have file offset 0, except those produced by
ifheaders_for_ecat7. Of course, AMIDE and xmedcon read ECAT7 files directly.

<h2><a name="report_problems">How to report problems</a></h2>
The general rule is: the more effort you do yourself, the more chance you 
have that someone will help you to fix it.
<ol>
<li>Make sure it is not a known problem: check this page for patches,
read the <a href="../wiki/" target="_parent">STIR Wiki</a>
and <strong>search</strong> the <a
href="../mailing_lists.htm">mailing lists.</a> (Use your favorite search engine or the link on that page.)
</li>
<li>Make sure it is not a problem with your data. For images,
use <tt>list_image_info</tt>, <tt>manip_image</tt>. For projection data 
<ol>
<li>use <tt>list_projdata_info</tt> to see if you and STIR agree on what the data sizes etc are.</li>
<li> use <tt>display_projdata</tt> (or <tt>manip_projdata</tt>) to look at all segments 
(not just a few).</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>In other cases, in particular if you have a segmentation fault,
you will have to build the debug version of STIR and debug the problematic 
program to at least see where it crashes. For instance when using
gdb, this goes as follows:
<pre>
gdb /wherever/it/is/STIR/debug/analytic/FBP2D/FBP2D 
gdb> cd /wherever/the/data/is
gdb> r myparameterfile
(wait till segmentation fault)
gdb> info stack
(some more gdb commands)
gdb> quit
</pre>
Ideally you then have a look at the value of some of the variables (use "p variablename"), maybe after moving up the call-stack ("up").
<br>
Follows the next link for the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/documentation/">GDB documentation</a>.
</li>

<li>Report the problem on the <a
href="../mailing_lists.htm">mailing lists.</a> Please provide as much
info as you can. In particular, also give details about OS and compiler version.
</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="contribute">How to contribute</a></h2>

<p>You are very (<i>very</i>) welcome to contribute to STIR. As STIR is Open Source,
you can distribute your work (including the rest of STIR) yourself. However, it
would of course be better to get your work included into the "official" STIR
distribution from this web-site. See our <a href="../contributing">page with more information.</a>

<h2><a name="Notes">Notes</a></h2>

<p >Please register on our <a
href="../mailing_lists.htm">mailing lists.</a> Questions about our
software will ONLY be answered when directed to one of the mailing lists.</p>

<p>After extracting the files, please check STIR/buildblock/Scanner.cxx to see
if the parameters of your scanner are correct. If not, let us know. You might
want to tell us about some more names for your scanner. (These names are used
to recognise the scanner in the Interfile header file (*.hs)).</p>
