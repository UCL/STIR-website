              <div class="contributionContent"><p><strong>Abstract</strong></p><p>Recent advancements in imaging technology have promoted widespread adoption of small-animal imaging, with the availability of dedicated high-resolution preclinical scanners increasing to satisfy this demand. Pinhole-SPECT systems are becoming increasingly important as they offer high-resolution and high-sensitivity solutions in preclinical studies. Previously, open-source image reconstruction software did not exist for pinhole-SPECT systems. A 3D SPECT system matrix modelling library specific for pinhole collimators has recently been integrated into STIR &ndash; an open-source software package for tomographic image reconstruction. The pinhole-SPECT library enables corrections for the spatially variant collimator-detector response and attenuation by&nbsp; incorporating their effects into the system matrix. Attenuation corrections can be calculated with a simple single line-of-response or a full model. The spatially variant collimator-detector response can be modelled with point spread function and depth of interaction calculations for increased system matrix accuracy. Improvements to computational speed and memory&nbsp; requirements can be made with image masking. This work presents tomographic images from measured and simulated data using a SiPM-based preclinical SPECT scanner featuring a single-pinhole collimator. To demonstrate the flexibility and accuracy of the combined software, reconstructed images were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. The extension of the open-source STIR project with advanced pinhole-SPECT modelling will enable the research community to study the impact of pinhole collimators in several SPECT imaging scenarios and with different scanners.</p></div>

              <div class="contributionContent"><p><strong>Abstract</strong></p><p>A new clinical brain positron emission tomography (PET) scanner NeuroLF with octagonal detector arrangement is being finalized. For rapid prototyping of the required steps for image reconstruction, the Python interface of the open-source Software for Tomographic Image Reconstruction (STIR) is used and extended depending on the specific requirements. This reconstruction pipeline implemented in Python includes normalisation procedures, reading listmode data, constructing random sinograms from single histograms, performing an initial reconstruction, registering an attenuation map to this initial reconstruction using the open-source software Nifty-Reg, estimating the scatter and finally the full reconstruction using all these corrections. The advantages of using STIR in Python are manifold: 1) data can be instantly visualised at any point in the pipeline, facilitating debugging and understanding of the inner workings; 2) all configuration settings are in one place, compared to various folders containing .par files and different intermediate&nbsp;.hs and .hv files when using STIR through executables; 3) batch processing is easily implemented; 4) the reconstruction pipeline can be shared with others more easily&nbsp;and is much clearer to understand. The pipeline will be demonstrated using&nbsp;jupyter notebooks.</p></div>

              <div class="contributionContent"><p><strong>Abstract</strong></p><p><strong>Background</strong>:<br />
                  SIMIND software for Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of SPECT data has been well-validated and used for several research applications in nuclear medicine. The MC model, based on a typical clinical gamma camera, can be configured for a range of different systems.<br />
                  SIMIND can be used with activity and density distributions defined using standard shapes. More flexibility is possible with voxel-based input data e.g. STIR generated images. The combination of SIMIND and STIR would be useful for investigating many aspects of SPECT imaging. However, each software system has its own conventions.<br />
                  This work investigated using STIR to provide input datasets to SIMIND and to perform reconstruction of MC output data.<br />
                  <strong>Methods:</strong><br />
                  Voxelwise test datasets, generated in STIR, were input to SIMIND. SIMIND output projections were then reconstructed with STIR. This identified aspects of each software system to consider for successful connection including data types, header files, definition of attenuation maps, unit conventions and coordinate systems.<br />
                  <strong>Results</strong>:<br />
                  A crib sheet, with pointers on connecting SIMIND and STIR was produced with detail on aspects of each software system referred to above. This could help current STIR users to connect SIMIND and STIR. A dummy dataset and some short scripts can also be made available to prospective SIMIND/STIR users.<br />
                  <strong>Conclusions:</strong><br />
                  Basic requirements to connect STIR and SIMIND software have been established. This could help researchers utilise both software systems in a range of SPECT imaging applications.</p></div>                        <div class="contributionAcknowledgment"><span class="contributionAcknowledgmentHeadline">Acknowledgment</span><p>RG is completing a PhD with funding from the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund via NPL.<br />
