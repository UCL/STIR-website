<h1>STIR at the IEEE MIC 2018 Short Course on Image Reconstruction </h1>
<p>This page is for participants in the <a href="http://www.nssmic.org/2018/?s=short-courses"  target=_blank>Short Course on Image Reconstruction</a> (SC9)
at the IEEE MIC. It will be updated with extra information before the course.
  <br />
  <strong>Please refresh the page when you re-visit.</strong> (In some browsers,
such as FireFox, a normal Page Refresh doesn't work. On windows, right-click on the page, select <i>This Frame</i> and <i>Release Frame</i>).<br />
Check the bottom of page for list of updates.</p>


<!--<p>After reading this page, please fill in <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/JLS9CPJ"  target=_parent>a 1 minute survey</a>.</p>
  -->
<p><strong>During the course, check <a href="https://padlet.com/krthie/STIRdemo">this page with additional links</a></strong></p>.

<p>During the course, we will have practical exercises using STIR. These exercises are an integral part of the course. 
To be able to participate, <strong>students are asked to bring their own laptop if possible</strong>.
</p>

<p>We provide a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine" target=_blank>Virtual Machine</a>
   with everything preinstalled for the course. Please <strong>follow
    the installation instructions below to get this on your laptop
    <i>before the conference</i></strong> (we will be available 15 minutes before the course to help with installation problems and will have some USB sticks with us as well).</p>
<p>We will also attempt to use cloud-based access (thanks to Ben Thomas, UCL), but this will
clearly depend on Internet access, so we strongly suggest to download the VM before the course.</p>
  
<p>Please note that the STIR version that we will be using is much more
   recent than the current official 3.0. Therefore, <strong>please use the virtual machine.</strong>
   If you really want to do this all yourself, you will need to get <a href=http://github.com/UCL/STIR target="_blank">STIR from
  github</a>, install <a href=http://www.swig.org target="_blank">SWIG</a>, Python, etc and compile STIR with
Python support. You would then need to get the <a href=http://github.com/UCL/STIR-exercises target="_blank">example scripts from
  github</a>. Don't try this at short notice...
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Please prepare for these exercises, see bottom of this page.</strong>
</p>

<h2>Virtual Machine installation instructions</h2>
<p>If you have any problems, please first re-check this web-page. If you cannot solve your
  issue, please email <tt>k dot thielemans at ucl dot ac dot uk</tt>.
</p>
<p>We are using a VM based on a framework developed by the 
<a href="http://www.ccppetmr.ac.uk" target=_blank>CCP PETMR project</a>, but 
with tweaks for the STIR exercises.
</p>
<h3>Initial download and installation</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Make sure you have enough free disk-space on your laptop (~10GB for installation).</li>
  <li>Install <a href=https://www.virtualbox.org/ target="_blank">VirtualBox</a>. <strong>Please note that this will require administrator permissions</strong>.   We recommend to use VirtualBox 5.2.18, although different versions should work
   (but you might have trouble with the VirtualBox Guest Additions, see the
    installation instructions further on).
  </li>
  <li>Download the STIR exercises Virtual Machine from
        <a href="https://liveuclac-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/rmhathi_ucl_ac_uk/EboGDYWeRAdIm92JEL3o8tYBthBFA7n7HyQxAztKc0V8Gw?e=FLgnMh" target=_blank>here</a>.
      <br />
    <strong><i>Warning</i>: this file is ~2GB</strong>. (You can of course download to a USB stick to save space on your laptop).
  </li>
  <li>Install the VM, <a href="https://github.com/CCPPETMR/CCPPETMR_VM/blob/master/INSTALL.md" target=_blank>instructions are here</a> (ignore links to the CCP PETMR download page and any mention of Gadgetron or SIRF)
  </li>
  <li>Check-out the 
      <a href="https://github.com/CCPPETMR/CCPPETMR_VM/wiki/Basic-usage" target=_blank>basic instructions on how to use the VM</a>
 </li>
<!--
  <li> The actual VM is still in preparation. However, you could already download a Virtual Image from <a href="http://www.ccppetmr.ac.uk/downloads" target=_blank>
   CCP PETMR</a> (use release 1.1.1). This VM contains SIRF (the CCP PETMR software for both PET and MR image reconstruction) but also STIR. After 
   following the <a href="https://github.com/CCPPETMR/CCPPETMR_VM/wiki" target=_blank>installation instructions of the Virtual Machine</a>,
   please type the following in a terminal in the VM (note that this will take quite a while).
     <pre>
       update_VM.sh
       update_VM_to_full_STIR.sh
       sudo apt-get install ipython ipython-qtconsole python-zmq csh
     </pre>
-->
      <!--https://sourceforge.net/projects/stir/files/VirtualMachine1/ the Sourceforge site</a> (get the Lubuntu-STIR.ova file).
<br />
    Please be careful on Sourceforge. Do not press any attractive Download buttons as they are all ads.
</li>
-->
</ol>

<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>  The files might need another update before the course (but with minimal download time).
  In particular, the exercises themselves will still change. Therefore,
  <i>please check this web-page occasionally</i>.
</p>
<p>Update process: open the terminal and just type
<pre>
  update_VM.sh
</pre>
</p>
<p><strong>We recommend that you get yourself (somewhat) familiar with VirtualBox and Ubuntu and iPython.</strong>
  Links are provided in the <a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR-exercises/blob/master/README.md" target=_blank>README.md.</a> (this is a simple text file in Markdown
format. It is nicely formatted on the web-site).<br />
  Here is some suggested material:
  <ol><li>If you have never used a Linux/Unix terminal before, have a look at
      <a href=https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal target=_blank>this tutorial</a>.
    </li>
    <li><a href=https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/ target=_blank>The official Python tutorial</a>. Just read Section 1, 3, a bit of 4 and a tiny bit of 6.
    </li>
    <li><a href=https://github.com/patvarilly/dsghent-python-for-data-scientists-2016/blob/master/notebooks/02_MatplotlibAndSeaborn.ipynb target=_blank>Examples for matplotlib</a>, the python module that allows you to
      make plots almost like in MATLAB.
    </li>
  </ol>
  It would also be useful to check some of the STIR <a href=../documentation>documentation on the STIR web-site</a>.
  You could even try to run some of the exercises already. Please check
  <a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR-exercises/blob/master/README.md" target=_blank>the README.md</a> for instructions.
